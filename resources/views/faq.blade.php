            Q: What is the Prize?
            <ol class="ps-5 mt-2 space-y-1 list-decimal list-inside">
                <li>Each pool has an entry fee, and a guaranteed prize. Each winner takes all the entry fee's + guaranteed prize</li>
                <li>One winner per pool. If there is more than 1 survivor by the end of the regular season the prize will be split, <span class="italic">*highly unlikely*</span></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
           How is the prize calculated, exactly?
            <ul class="ps-5 mt-2 space-y-1 list-decimal list-inside">
                <li>Unless otherwise directed, prize will be paid in deposited funds. Since we offer multiple cryptos it's a bit complicated to just add all the decimals together, therefore pool prize's are automatically updated and shown using USD. </li>
                <li>Winner will be paid using the deposited funds. Which may be more, or less than the displayed USD valuation at the time a winner is declared. We'll try to make this more transparent. </li>
